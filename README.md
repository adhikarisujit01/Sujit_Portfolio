# Project 1: Predictive Analytics on 2021/2022 UEFA Champions League Using Machine Learning
  - Created a tool that predicts the winner of the Champions League football
  - Scrapped over 1500 players data using python.
  - Optimized Logistic Regression, Random Forest and KNN models to reach the best model. 
  - Logitstic Regression Model gave the highest accuracy of 87%, therefore decided to use this model to predict the result
  - Used Random Pairing Method to pair the matches randomly.


# Project 2: Statistical Analysis Analyzing Factors Influencing Credit Card Approval and Credit Limit
  - Created a model to analyze the housing market scenario in SF Bay Area
  - Built Multivariate Regression Model to assess different variables that impact the housing prices
  - Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to see a better picture of the correlation among different variables and the housing prices.
  - Built a Power BI dashboard to present the Bay Area Housing Market Situation and possible future downsides
  - Performed trend analysis to compare and analyze the housing market during 2008 crash and 2020 market imbalance
  - Concluded that with the possible fed interest rate rising in late 2021 or early 2022, the demand for Bay Area Housing will eventually decrease, however, this would       also take some number of years to bring the prices to a market equilibrium point.
